# Local-AI. Offline First AI for Everyone

> Run AI models entirely on your own device, without cloud, subscriptions, or internet access.

## Overview

**Local-AI** is an open-source project that empowers users to run powerful language models (LLMs) on their local devices — even with limited computing power. Whether you're working on a feature phone, an older CPU-based laptop, or deploying to rural areas with unreliable connectivity, Local-AI gives you full control over your data and models.

This project uses the following stack:

- [Ollama](https://ollama.com) — to run and customize LLMs on macOS, Linux, and Windows
- [Open Web UI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) — a browser-based chat interface, offline and open-source
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) — for simple and reproducible deployments
